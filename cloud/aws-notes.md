Rough calculations for t2.micro:

A **t2.micro** instance comes with 1 GB, from which you can utilize around 920 Mb, arnd 100mb get consumed by other system process. 
If a single user connection takes around 20MB of memory, 
then parallely you can server 920/20 = **46 users**. That means around 46 users can give test in parallel. 
However if users are not concurrent(parallel) then you can server thousands of users. 
Based on my experiences I can say you cannot server 2000 users concurrently on T2 micro. However if concurrency is 10â€“15, You can easily serve.
